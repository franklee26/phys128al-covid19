## Usage & contribution
Feel free to use the code, make comments & suggestions and contribute via PRs.

## Notes
* To use the first stochastic model, run `make run` in the `sir/src/` directory. This generates NEW data per run (will implement caching later). Runtime reduced from ~156 seconds to ~50 seconds.
